### ⚡ **What’s ANU?**

ANU ain’t your average tweak, it’s a full blown **SurfaceFlinger dominator**.
This Magisk module takes your Android surfaceflinger and throws it into overdrive. Forget stutters, kill that lag, and flex your frames like a boss.

### 🔥 **What Does It Do?**

Here’s what ANU brings to the table:
- **SurfaceFlinger Boost**
- **Frame Timing**
- **HWUI Rendering Tweaks**
- **Touch Input**
- **Animations Turbo**
- **ART Runtime Boost**
- **VSYNC & Refresh Rate Control**
- **And more secret sauce under the hood.**

### 🧠 **Why ANU?**

Because stock settings are for normies. You want **raw speed**, **buttery frames**, and **no excuses**.
ANU is here to **obliterate lag** and give your device that **next level smoothness** you didn’t know was possible.

### ⚠️ **Disclaimer**

Not responsible if your phone turns into a spaceship (or just reboots). Use at your own risk.

### 📲 **How to Install**

1. Flash the module via **Magisk Manager**.
2. Reboot your device.
3. Enjoy frames bowing to your command.
